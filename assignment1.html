    <h1>Which island should I move to?</h1>
    <p>Before you move on to the nitty gritty details, first you must decide which island is best. Here are some things to consider:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Cost</li>
        <li>Economy</li>
        <li>Entertainment</li>
        <li>Transportation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Oahu</h2>
    <p><span style="padding:0px 15px 0px 0px; float:left;"><img src="http://www.willhiteweb.com/hawaii_travel/oahu_sights/oahu-tourist-map.jpg" alt="map of Oahu" width="300px"></span>The island of <strong>Oahu</strong>, is the most populated of the Hawaiian islands and is where the capital of Honolulu and world-famous Waikiki are located. Most people who choose to move to Hawaii choose Oahu because it has the most job opportunties and action. This is the most similar to most American cities, but you have the beach close to everything.Most jobs on Oahu are in tourism, government/military, construction, agriculture, retail sales and healthcare.      </p>
    <h2>Maui</h2>
    <p>The island of <strong>Maui</strong> is the second most populated island and has less job opportunities than Oahu.The two main industries are tourism and agriculture. Kahului, Lahaina and Kihei areas are the biggest cities on the island.
    </p>
    <h2>Big Island</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Big Island</strong> is the largest of the Hawaiian islands. Tourism is the island's main industry, centered mainly on the west shore of the island, known as Kona. This island has recently been gaining popularity as a tourist destination.
    </p>
    <h2>Kauai</h2>
    <p><strong>Kauai's</strong> main economy is tourism like the other islands, followed by government and retail. Life on Kauai is very laid-back and the nighttime entertainment options are very limited. But if you're looking for peace and quiet, you'll find it here.
